# Golang Memory Management with Slab Allocator

Welcome to the Golang Memory Management with Slab Allocator repository! This repository contains code examples and resources related to the article [Advancing Performance with Slab Allocator in Golang: Practical Implementations](https://medium.com/@m.lando_60183/advancing-performance-with-slab-allocator-in-golang-practical-implementations-cf1850ab34f5).


## Introduction

This repository provides practical examples and code snippets to help you understand how to implement efficient memory management using Slab Allocators in Golang. The examples demonstrate the benefits of Slab Allocation in optimizing memory usage and improving performance.

## Most important contents

- **[main.go]**: This main contains code examples that illustrate the practical implementation of Slab Allocation in Golang. You'll find detailed explanations and comments within the code.

- **[ringBufferSlab](ringBufferSlab/)**: Here, you can access to ring buffer of byte slice using Slab.
- **[ringBufferSlabInterface](ringBufferSlabInterface/)**: Here, you can access to ring buffer of interface using Slab allocator .
